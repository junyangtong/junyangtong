My name is **junyangtong**, I am a Technical Artist Engineer currently living in Shanghai, China. I work in Unity game development using C# and HLSL to implement rendering effects and performance optimizations. I'm also learning Houdini, as well as C++ and DirectX 12. My long-term goal is to create an indie game that people will love. ðŸŽ®âœ¨
